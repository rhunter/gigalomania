<hr>

<p>Gigalomania is an open source 2D Real Time Strategy game, available for all popular desktop and mobile platforms, on PCs, tablets and phones. The gameplay consists of researching and developing new technology with which to conquer your enemies, from rocks and sticks
to nuclear weapons and spaceships. You can advance through ten different ages, from the stone age to the future. There are 28 different maps to play through.</p>

<p>This game is a work in progress. The gameplay is more or less complete, but the graphics need improving :) Please <a href="#helpwanted">see below</a> if you want to help out.</p>

<p>Gigalomania is available for: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Nokia (Symbian, Belle), Maemo, Meego, and Android.</p>

<p><a name="requirements"><b>Requirements</b></p>

<p>Gigalomania should work on any non-ancient Windows, Linux or OS X PC. Gigalomania is tested on
Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit) and Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit, and with Intel GMA 3100 and ATI Radeon HD
6570 graphics. Older versions ran okay on Windows XP, and with NVIDIA (6100, 8600GT) graphics.
(See the <a href="http://www.herzig-net.de/prog/?page=prog-macgiga">Mac homepage</a> for details
on the Mac version.)</p>

<p>For Nokia Symbian smartphones, this requires S60 5th edition (Symbian^1) or later (e.g.,
Nokia 5800) - the Ovi Store should let you know if it's compatible with your phone. For Maemo,
this has been tested on the Nokia N900. For Meego, this has been tested on the Nokia N950.</p>

<p>For Android, this requires Android 2.3.3, and has been tested on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
A resolution of at least 480x320 is recommended.
This also requires installing the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.necessitas.ministro">Ministro</a>, which you should be prompted to do when you first run
Gigalomania (if it's not already installed). Ministro manages the required Qt libraries on Android. These will be downloaded if required when you first run Gigalomania. If you get an error message such as "Ministro can not satisfy your application dependencies", please ensure you have enough storage space (the libraries can take up to around 25MB).</p>

<p>I have had some reports of a crash on startup for Android, which unfortunately I can't reproduce on my phone. If this does happen, please <a href="#contact">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>If the game fails to run, or has problems, please try the following:<ul>
  <li>For Windows, make sure you have installed the required libraries/DLLs (see Windows download,
  above).</li>
  <li>On Linux, try running from the command line (from Terminal window, type gigalomania) to see
  if that gives any informative error message.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.</li>
  <li>On Android, on rare occasions Ministro may fail to download the required libraries due to network or server problems - please try again later to see if the problem still persists.</li>
  <li>Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to report any problems.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>On PC platforms, Gigalomania also supports using the graphics from Mega Lo Mania (from the Amiga version) if you have that game. The "data/" folder should be copied into the main gigalomania/ folder, and then rename the "gfx/" folder to something else (e.g., "xgfx/").</p>

<p><a name="quickstart"><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Select game type "SINGLE ISLAND".</li>
	<li>Select a player (it doesn't really matter who).</li>
	<li>Click "PLAY ISLAND".</li>
	<li>A number (initially '0') will appear; move the mouse over it and increase the number by clicking the right mouse button (or on touchscreen platforms, touch the number, then use the arrows that appear to increase the number of people).
  This is to select how many people you want to play the island - the more people, the easier it is. In the full game, you have a fixed number of people to use across all the islands, but for this demo you can choose as many as you like. On the first age, try about 15-20 people to begin with, then adjust accordingly for future games if you want the game to be easier or harder. Later ages will require more people.</li>
	<li>Select one of the squares of the island shown in the top left. Each square (or "sector") has different elements in it, which affects what things you can make, and how quickly; some sectors may be better than others. When you click on a square, the game will start.</li>
  <li>
    Screen layout:<ul>
      <li>In the top left corner is a map of the island. The currently displayed sector is highlighted with a grid.
      Coloured boxes in a square represent sectors which are occupied by either you or the computer players. Smaller coloured boxes
      in the corner of a square represent armies that are present in that sector. To the right of the map are
      displayed the player shields. If any armies are in the current sector, then the number of soldiers in each army for each player will
      be displayed next to the shield. Above the shields is a picture of a arrow - clicking left or right button on this
      icon changes the speed of the game (or on touchscreen platforms, click this icon to cycle through the three rates of time).</li>
      <li>In the main screen area is a depiction of the current sector. This may show buildings that are in the sector,
      along with armies.</li>
      <li>To the left, below the map is the main control panel. Firstly, the name of the island and the age for the
      current sector is displayed. For sectors which you control (i.e., have a tower in), an interface is below that,
      giving you control over things which are done in this sector.</li>
      <li>Most parts of the interface should have popup help text which explains what you can do by pressing which mouse
      buttons (though not on touchscreen platforms).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the main control panel to the left, click the lightbulb icon ("VIEW AND ALTER CURRENT DESIGN"). A new panel
  will appear, with three columns of icons. Select one on the right most column, e.g., the rock icon ("DESIGN A ROCK
  WEAPON"). Now some additional icons will appear just below the lightbulb, including an icon of a man, with the number
  "0" below him. Use the right mouse button to click on the man icon, and increase the number (or on touchscreen platforms,
  click on the man icon, then use the arrows that appear) - this is the number of
  people designing the weapon you have selected. The clock will start counting down.</li>
  <li>When the design is complete, you will be told "Ergonomically terrific" or "The design is completed" at the bottom
  of the screen. Click the lightbulb at the top of the main control panel, to return to the main interface ("RETURN TO
  SECTOR CONTROL"). Then click the shield icon ("VIEW ARMY WEAPON STOCKS AND ASSEMBLE ARMY") to go to the army screen.</li>
  <li>The icon for the weapon you designed will be displayed, with "OK" beneath it to indicate that you can make the
  weapon. Click and hold down the left mouse button to add people armed with this weapon to your army. The total number in
  your army is displayed beneath the shield icon to the lower right.</li>
  <li>The mouse cursor should now have changed to a shield icon. Move the mouse over the map at the top left. Click on
  the map square containing the enemy tower.</li>
  <li>The army will be deployed, and the map will switch to the new sector. Your people will attack the buildings there,
  and eventually destroy them. The AI may deploy soldiers to defend, depending on what weapons they have invented.</li>
  <li>To complete the island successfully, you must destroy all enemy towers and people.</li>
</ul>
A video of a playthrough for the first island is
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YzhuXQXF-o">available on YouTube</a> (shown on the
Nokia N900).</p>

<p><a name="controls"><b>Controls</b></p>

<p>The game can be entirely controlled with the mouse, though additional keys are: P - [un]pause game; Q - quit and return to start screen.
There is also an option to enable a one mouse button interface, rather than requiring two mouse buttons - to enable, go to "Options" (from the screen
where you select an Island to play), and click to change to "ONE MOUSE BUTTON UI". This allows playing on touchscreens, and may be preferable for some
users (e.g., on touchpads). Note that this interface mode is always enabled for some platforms known to be touchscreen (Symbian, Maemo, Meego, Android).</p>

<p><a name="gametypes"><b>Game types</b></p>
 
<p>When you first load the game, you can choose between two game types:<ul>
  <li>Single Island: You can choose to play on any island of any age you like.  Use "NEXT ISLAND" and "NEXT AGE" to
  select the island and age. You always have a large pool of people, from which you can play with as many as you like.
  Essentially this game style treats each Island as an individual game, with no scorekeeping between islands. (This is
  the only form of gameplay available in versions 0.13 and earlier.)</li>
  <li>All Islands: Here you must start on the first age. Each time you win and island, it is removed from the list,
  and you do not play it again; only when every island in an age is completed do you advance to the next age.
  Within each age, you may choose the order in which to play the islands by selecting "NEXT ISLAND". You only have a
  limited amount of people (determined by the difficulty level that you choose on the next screen),
  and receive an additional allocation each age. Be careful not to use them all up too soon!
  The options menu in the main screen also has options for saving and loading games.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You then choose which colour player you wish to be (this currently has no effect, other than
the colour used to identify your units).</p>

<p><a name="mainmenu"><b>Main menu</b></p>

<p>Next you will be shown the main menu. To the top left will be shown an island to play,
identified by the text to the left (e.g., "Alpha of the First Age").</p>

<p>There are ten ages in total: 10000BC, 2000BC, 1AD, 900AD, 1400AD, 1850AD, 1914AD, 1944AD, 1980AD, 2100AD. For
each island you start in a particular age, and can advance up to three ages in the future (eg, if you start in
10000BC  then you can advance until 900AD). Note that different sectors can be in different ages - the age is
a measure of the current level of technology, rather than how much time has passed.</p>

<p>The main menu options are as follows:<ul>
  <li>"Next Island" - cycle through the islands available to play in this age. In "All Islands"
  playing mode, once you have completed an island, it will no longer be available to play
  (unless you start a new game).</li>
  <li>"Next Age" (available in "Single Island" playing mode only) - Cycles through the ages to
  play.</li>
  <li>"Options" - displays a sub menu as follows:<ul>
    <li>"Continue" - return to the main menu.</li>
    <li>"Sound On/Off" - whether sound is currently enabled - click to change this.</li>
    <li>"One/Two Mouse Button UI" - in two mouse button mode, the left and right mouse buttons
    are required. In one mouse button mode, only the left mouse button is required (e.g., changing
    the number of people is done by left clicking, then clicking on the left/right arrows that
    appear). Useful for touchpads or touchscreens. (Symbian, Maemo, Meego, Android don't have this option,
    as they are always in one mouse button mode.)</li>
    <li>"New Game" (available in "All Islands" playing mode only) - restarts the game.</li>
    <li>"Load Game" (available in "All Islands" playing mode only) - loads a previously saved
    game.</li>
    <li>"Save Game" (available in "All Islands" playing mode only) - saves the game. There are
    10 available slots to save in.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>"Play Island" - start playing the currently displayed island.</li>
  <li>"Online Help" (Nokia Symbian and Android only) - launches the browser to this web page.</li>
  <li>"Quit" - exits the game (not available on Android, where applications never "quit").</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="maingame"><b>Main game</b></p>

<p>See <a href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a>, above, for a basic introduction for the game. This
section now explains the game and interface in more depth.</p>

<p>The map of the island is shown in the top left. Click on a square to view that sector. You can also
move armies by right clicking on a square with one of your armies, and then left clicking on the destination
square (not available on touchscreen platforms).</p>

<p>When there are more than two players (including you), you can try forming an alliance by clicking on their
player shield (sometimes you may be asked to join an alliance, too). There must always be at least two opposing
sides (so an alliance with three players is only possible when there are four sides; if a player is wiped out,
this may cause an alliance to break up).</p>

<p>To the left, below the map, is the main control panel which is displayed when viewing one of your sectors. The following
icons are available. Many of these icons take you to a sub-menu when you click - to return to the main menu, click the icon that
appears at the top of the sub-menu (just below the island map):<ul>
  <li><b>Top row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Person icon - displays how many spare people in the tower - this doesn't include people put to work (see below),
    or armies in the current sector outside the tower. Spare people will, left to their own devices, gradually reproduce and
    grow your population.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shield icon - displays the health status of each building. When you are attacked by enemy armies, the health will
    go down, until each building is destroyed! If a building is destroyed, you lose all the men inside that building. If
    the tower is destroyed, you lose control of the sector! Once you have designed/manufactured shields (see below), you
    can use them to repair buildings - click on the shield (the mouse will change to a shield icon - on touchscreens, a shield
    icon will appear in the top right corner), then click on the building you wish to repair. Note that shields for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Defences icon - allows you to deploy defenders. Once you have designed/manufactured defensive weapons (see below),
    you may deploy them to the building turrets (if you haven't, this icon won't be available). Click on the desired defence
    weapon (the mouse will change to a shield icon - on touchscreens, a shield icon will appear in the top right corner), then
    click on a building turret to deploy. You can also return defenders back inside by not clicking on a defensive weapon (or
    clicking again to disable the deployment), and click on a turret that has a defender deployed. Note that defensive weapons for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Armies icon - allows you to deploy armies. One you have designed/manufactured offensive weapons (see below), you may
    deploy them. You can also deploy unarmed men, which are weaker, and can't attack buildings at all (but can help fight enemy
    armies). Click on the icons to add men to the army, then when ready, either click on a map square at the top left, or click
    in the main sector view (to the middle/right of the screen). Note that offensive weapons for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below). Also note that for offensive weapons for 1400AD onwards, more than one
    person may be required for each weapon you deploy.
  </li>
  <li><b>2nd row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Blueprints icon - once you have designed any shields or weapons (see below), this will allow you to view your designs, and how much
    of each type of <i>element</i> it takes to build one. Elements must be gathered or mined (see below), and you only have a
    limited amout of each element in the sector. Viewing the blueprints of designs allows you to see how much you need to mine
    of each element. Once all the elements are used up, you can trash the design by clicking on the dustbin icon with both mouse
    buttons (or just a standard touch on touchscreen platforms). In some cases, it may be possible to design the invention again, with
    whatever remaining elements you have left.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design (lightbulb or potion) icon - this allows you to design shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons. Each age has one shield,
    defensive weapon and offensive weapon associated with it. Click on what you want
    to design, then click on the person icon to change the number of designers. More designers will mean less time to design it, but
    leaves less people to do other things (including reproducing). Note that designs for 1914AD onwards require a Lab to be built first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Factory icon - designs for 1400AD onwards must be manufactured rather than being created automatically. Use the factory to do this:
    select which design to manufacture, then set the two numbers: the top is the number of factory workers, the number below is the number to
    manufacture. More factory workers make the job go quicker, but leaves less men for other tasks!
  </li>
  <li><b>3rd row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Element icons - Elements are required to design and create shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons. There are various types of
    elements. Gatherables are picked up automatically. From 2000BC onwards, you sector may have an open pit mine (marked by a large hole shown
    in the main sector view), which requires you to assign people to mine those elements. From 900AD onwards you can build a mine, which may show
    more elements that can be mined (again, you need to assign people to mine each element). Each sector has a different set (and amount) of elements,
    which affects which designs you can make. In later ages, you may find you need to mine elements before you can design anything (since designs only
    show if you have enough of the required elements).
  </li>
  <li><b>Bottom row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Building icons:<ul>
      <li>
        From 900AD you can build a mine, which allows the mining of additional elements (in later ages, you may need to build a mine
        before you can design anything).
      </li>
      <li>
        From 1400AD you can build a factory, which allows manufacturing of shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons for age 1400AD
        onwards (see above).
      </li>
      <li>
        From 1850AD you can build a lab, which is required for designing shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons for age 1914AD
        onwards.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="armies"><b>Armies</b></p>

<p>Once you have deployed your army (see above), you can move them to another sector by right clicking on the main sector view (not on a building)
(for touchscreen platforms, just tap normally) (the mouse icon will change to a shield - for touchscreen platforms, a shield will appear in the top
right corner), then click on the square on the map view in the top left, where you want the army to move to. You can also move armies using only the
map, by right clicking on a square to select an army in that square (non-touchscreen platforms only).</p>

<p>To return an army to a tower in one of your sectors, first move the army to that sector (if not there already). Then select the army by right clicking
on the main sector view (or normal tap for touchscreen platforms), then left click on your tower (the main building with four turrets).</p>

<p>In later ages, you will find maps that have squares not connected (i.e., separated by sea) - in these cases, only air units can move between them.
Air units are available in ages 1914AD, 1944AD and 2100AD.</p>

<p>The offensive weapon corresponding to 1980AD is a nuclear missile, which can be used to destroy any sector completely! This is deployed like a normal
army, but such an army can only contain 1 nuclear missile, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The defensive weapon corresponding to 1980AD is a nuclear defence. This does not defend your sector, but if the sector is nuked, one of these will launch
and nuke the sector from where the nuclear missile came from.</p>

<p>The defensive weapon corresponding to 2100AD is a laser. This defends both against conventional and nuclear attack.</p>

<p>As well as attacking your enemies, an army can build new towers in unclaimed sectors. When your army is in a sector with no other players, a clock will
appear as they build a new tower. Once the tower is built, you have control of the sector just like your first sector. Note that sectors you control behave
fairly independently - e.g., each sector has its own set of designs, elements and so on. Only people and offensive weapons can be transferred between sectors,
by deploying armies.</p>

<p><a name="suspendedanimation"><b>Suspended animation</b></p>

<p>When a sector reaches 2100AD (possible in Age 7 onwards), it is possible to place some
of your people in suspended animation, to "save" them. This has no real effect when playing in "Single Island" mode,
but in "All Islands" mode, it contributes to your final score if you complete the game (finish all the islands).</p>

      phone to a PC and selecting "mass storage" to view the drives (though this may only be possible
      if you've installed to an external SD card).
    </li>
    <li>
      For Android, it's located in the folder net.sourceforge.gigalomania/. You can view with a file
      explorer app (such as
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a>),
      or access by connecting your phone/tablet to a PC. If you can't see the folder, try rebooting your
      phone before connecting to your PC.
    </li>
  </ul>
  The log file is overwritten each time you run the game, so you'll have to take a copy straight
  away - although note that the last-but-one game log will be available under "log_old.txt"; in
  the case of assertion failures, it will also be copied to "log_assertion_failure.txt".</li>
  <li>If under Linux and no log.txt file is generated, try running gigalomania from a Terminal
  window, and note if that gives any error messages.</li>
  <li>A description of what happened, and what steps you took that resulted in the bug.</li>
  <li>Does the bug happen every time?</li>
  <li>Any details of your system may also be helpful, e.g.: operating system and version, CPU, graphics
  card, Direct X version if relevant, make/model of smartphone/tablet if relevant.</li>

<p><b>Help wanted!</b></p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to Gigalomania, there are various ways you can help:<ul>
<li><b>Musicians</b> - Some music would be nice to add to the game. Note that if you place an OGG music file "gamemusic.ogg" in the main folder, it will play during the game (at least for Windows/OS X/Linux). More sound effects would also be useful to have.</li>
<li><b>Graphics artists</b> - I have a graphics artist working on some images, though there's no reason why there couldn't be additional graphics sets for different styles, so feel free to contribute. Please contact me if you want info on the expected graphics formats, or things like additional data files (e.g., the POV Ray files for the building graphics).</li>
<li><b>Porting</b> - Feel free to port Gigalomania to other platforms - it should be easy to port to any OS that supports SDL or Qt. If you send me the files, I can integrate them into the main source. (Please check the Git repository on Sourceforge for the latest version to work with.)</li>
<li><b>Tell people about it!</b> - If you like the game, then please feel free to tell other
       people about it, on your blog/Twitter/website/etc :)</li>
<li><b>Give me a nice rating :)</b> (On Nokia/Android stores, or other hosting sites...)
<li><b>Videos</b> - videos of the gameplay (e.g., on YouTube) would be useful to have, partly to help raise awareness, and also to act as gameplay tutorials.</li>
</ul></p>
